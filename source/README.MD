# Installation

Requires Node 10.x

Need to create a credentials file for AWS and put it in the proper place. 

Alternative methods probably exist but you can google those yourself.

From cmd prompt: 

npm install discord.io aws-sdk -save

node erneh.js

IMPORTANT:

-LOADS ARE SLOW FOR A REASON, READ THIS BEFORE YOU ALTER OR RUN LOADS:

	-Load = money. 
	
	-Only run that script if you're willing to pay for AWS dynamoDB usage. 
	
	-It charges per read/write transaction. 
	
	-###It also charges for the READ/WRITE SPEED! That's why there's a limiter on speed
