# This is v0.1 of the BBGM Multiplayer Discord Bot.

### The vision behind this bot is to provide a complete multiplayer BBGM experience through the use of a discord bot.
#### We want people to be able to create leagues, join leagues, execute trades, and more!
#### Hopefully we can make multiplayer BBGM more accessible, as well as encouraging the development of existing leagues, increase experimentation and make moderation processes easier and more transparent.

## The current command descriptions are located in the commands/help folder.
### Current working features are:

- Read from a static JSON file and respond to queries in a server for player names.
	- Display information about player's:
		- Age
		- Contract
		- Country
		- OVR
		- POT
		- All attributes
		- Previous season PER and EWA
